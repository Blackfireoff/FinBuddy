FinBuddy is an AI-powered Web3 assistant designed to help users understand their wallet activity and stay informed about market trends. It connects to any crypto wallet in read-only mode and uses data from Blockscout to analyze transactions, detect risks, and summarize token performance. FinBuddy explains every action on-chain in clear, human language, helping users know where their money goes, what each transaction means, and whether something looks suspicious. It also highlights trending tokens, active protocols, and shifts in portfolio value. By combining blockchain analytics with natural language reasoning, FinBuddy aims to make crypto management simple, transparent, and insightful for everyone.
